Simple implementation of Russian Peasant Multiplication

Russian Peasant Multiplication is a way to multiply two numbers, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient\_Egyptian_multiplication#Russian_peasant_multiplication)

I first discovered Russian Peasant Multiplication in [Combinatorics by Cameron](https://www.amazon.com/Combinatorics-Techniques-Algorithms-Peter-Cameron/dp/0521457610). I wrote a function while working on proving Russian Peasant Multiplication.
