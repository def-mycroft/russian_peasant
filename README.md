Simple implementation of Russian Peasant Multiplication.

Russian Peasant Multiplication is a way to multiply two numbers, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient\_Egyptian_multiplication#Russian_peasant_multiplication)

I first discovered Russian Peasant Multiplication in [Combinatorics by Cameron](https://www.amazon.com/Combinatorics-Techniques-Algorithms-Peter-Cameron/dp/0521457610). I wrote these functions as a way to think about how to prove the RPM algorithm.

I also asked a question on the [Mathematics StackExchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2099095/proof-of-russian-peasant-multiplication).
